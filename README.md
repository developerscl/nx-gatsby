# NxGatsby

## Goal

- check how the Gatsby works with Nx

## Documentation

- [Nx](docs/nx.md)

- [Project creation commands (steps)](docs/project-creation-commands.md)

## Project dependency graph

- TODO: generate and add it here

## Findings

- at the first try it's possible to add the Gatsby site inside of the nx workspace, the only point until now was to add the support to the project it was needed to run the following command:

`npm i --save-dev @nrwl/gatsby gatsby-cli`

- ?
