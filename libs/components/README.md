# components

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

> this library uses the default approach from the Nx tools, which is a black box, where you need to define which components of the current library will be accessible from outside through the `src/index.tsx`

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test components` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
